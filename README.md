# Survey & Remote Work Access Guide (2025)

## Who this guide is for

This guide is for people doing online surveys, AI data tasks, and remote gig work on platforms such as:

- HeyPiggy

- Swagbucks

- Mako AI

- Remotasks

Similar region-restricted or trust-scored platforms

If you’ve experienced:

- Surveys suddenly disappearing

- Accounts getting limited or shadow-restricted

- Tasks showing inconsistently

- Different results across devices or sessions

this guide explains why that happens and how people usually reduce instability.

This is not a workaround guide and not tied to any single provider. It’s a practical overview based on how these platforms typically evaluate access and trust.

## Why surveys disappear or accounts get limited

Most survey and task platforms don’t block users randomly. They rely on automated trust systems that evaluate multiple signals together.

Common reasons access degrades:

### Location mismatch
IP country does not match account history, device signals, or expected region.

### Reused or polluted IPs
Shared IPs previously flagged by other users can affect your account even if you did nothing wrong.

### Over-rotation of IPs
Changing IPs too frequently can look automated or risky, especially during logins or task acceptance.

### Browser fingerprint inconsistencies
Device, OS, timezone, and browser signals don’t align with IP location.

### Platform trust scoring
Many platforms silently score accounts over time rather than issuing immediate bans.

This is why users often report:

- “My account still works, but I see fewer surveys.”

- That usually means trust degradation, not a hard ban.

## IP & location basics

Understanding IP types matters more than choosing a specific provider.

### Mobile IPs

- Real mobile carrier IPs

- Very high trust

- Expensive and often unstable for long sessions

- Often rotate automatically

Used when maximum trust is required, but not ideal for consistent daily survey work.

### Residential IPs

- IPs assigned to real household connections

- Widely used for surveys and remote work

- Can be rotating or sticky

- Good balance between trust and accessibility.

### ISP (static residential) IPs

Residential-grade IPs hosted through ISPs

Typically static for long periods (days or weeks)

Combine residential trust with session stability

Often preferred for:

Long-term survey accounts

AI task platforms (e.g. Remotasks, Mako AI)

Multi-account workflows where consistency matters

## Why datacenter IPs usually fail

- Easily identifiable as non-residential

- Frequently shared and abused

- Low trust for survey and gig platforms


## Stability > rotation (key insight most people miss)

One of the biggest mistakes survey users make is rotating IPs too often.

Why this backfires:

- Trust systems expect consistency, not novelty

- Frequent IP changes during logins raise risk flags

- “Fresh IP every request” looks automated, not human

What tends to work better:

- Long sessions on the same IP

- Reusing the same browser profile

- Matching timezone, language, and location signals

This is why many experienced users prefer sticky residential or ISP-type setups over aggressive rotation.

## Tools people commonly use 

These tools are commonly mentioned across survey and remote work communities

### Proxies

- Proxy IP quality score tools

### Browsers & profile management

- Anti-detect browsers (for separating accounts)

- Dedicated browser profiles per account

### IP & location verification

- IP geolocation checkers

- ASN / ISP lookup tools

### Fingerprint consistency checks

- Browser fingerprint test pages

- WebRTC & timezone leak testers

### Performance & reliability

- Speed test tools

- Basic uptime or connection stability checks

The goal is consistency, not complexity.

## Example setups (practical & anonymous)
### Basic setup (single account)

Residential IP (sticky session)

One browser profile

Same IP used consistently

## More stable setup (long-term accounts)

- Static residential / ISP IP

- One browser profile per account

- Same IP reused daily

- Controlled usage patterns

Often preferred for:

- AI task platforms (e.g. Remotasks, Mako AI)

- Users managing multiple survey accounts responsibly

## Providers people use 

Different users prefer different providers depending on region availability, pricing, and session control. Examples that are commonly mentioned include:

- NodeMaven

- Smartproxy

- Bright Data

- Oxylabs

Others depending on region

Some users prefer [NodeMaven](https://nodemaven.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=reddit&utm_campaign=surveys) specifically for:

- Stable residential and ISP-type IPs

- Long session support

- Multi-account-friendly setups for surveys and remote work
